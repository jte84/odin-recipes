    <h1>Pasta with Brown Butter and Parmesan</h1>

    <h3>Another Italian Classic</h3>
    
    <h4>Sometimes you just want a big bowl of pasta with butter and Parmesan. Starchy, silky and salty, it's always good — and practically foolproof. To make it a little more grown up, just take it one step further: Brown the butter. When you slide the butter into the skillet, let it cook until the milk solids turn a toasty brown. It adds a rich, nutty flavor that makes the dish a bit more sophisticated with very little extra work.</h4>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Kosher Salt</li>
    <li>1 pound spaghetti, linguine or other long noodle</li>
    <li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
    <li>Freshly Ground Black Pepper</li>
</ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of heavily salted water (2 heaping tablespoons kosher salt to about 7 quarts water) to a boil. Add pasta to boiling water and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve ½ cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta, but don't shake it fully dry.</li>
    <li>In a skillet or Dutch oven large enough to hold the pasta (and preferably with a light-colored bottom so you can see the butter solids brown), melt the butter over medium heat. Cook, swirling occasionally, until the foam subsides, the milk solids turn golden-brown and it smells nutty and toasty, 3 to 4 minutes. (Watch carefully to see that it does not burn. If it does, start over.) Remove from heat immediately.</li>
    <li>Add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss with the brown butter. Stir in the cheese until melted. Stir in pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the pasta is glossy with sauce (you probably won't need the full ½ cup).</li>
   <li>Serve with black pepper and more Parmesan on top.</li>

</ol>
